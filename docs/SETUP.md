## Setup

### pipenv

Pipenv is used to manage all python dependencies.

```shell
pip install pipenv
```

```shell
pipenv install -d
```

```shell
pipenv shell
```

### npm

npm is used to manage all node dependencies.

```shell
npm install
```

### pre-commit

[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) is used to enforce standards on this repository prior to committing any changes. This forms part of
our [Contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md) standards. Please also see the
[pre-commit-config.yaml](../.pre-commit-config.yaml) file.

This is installed via the Pipfile, though this has to be initialised within this repository by running the below
command:

```shell
pre-commit install
```
